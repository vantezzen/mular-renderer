# Mular Renderer

Mular Renderer is a modified version of the Vidar Video Editing Framework for JavaScript.

## Running the Examples

First, download the assets for the examples:

```
npm run assets
```

Then, start the development server (only used for convience while developing;
you don't need a server to use Vidar):

```
npm start
```

Now you can open any example (such as
http://127.0.0.1:8080/examples/introduction/hello-world1.html).
